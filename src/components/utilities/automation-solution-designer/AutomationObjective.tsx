        Objective: Guide architects, developers, and business analysts through a structured assessment process to design a standardized, architecturally sound, and cost-effective technology stack for automation use cases. This tool replaces experience-based or subjective technology selection with a principled approach, ensuring your team uses the right combination of tools (for example, when to use Bizagi vs Power Platform, when to use general AI vs custom AI) for each automation scenario.
