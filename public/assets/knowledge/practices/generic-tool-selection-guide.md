# Generic Tool Selection Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a structured, six-stage funnel-based evaluation process for conducting the broadest strategic screening in the early stages and progressively delving into details as the process moves forward. This ensures that only the candidate solutions that best meet strategic, architectural, and financial requirements advance to the final decision-making phase.

## The Multi-Stage Tool Selection Process

The selection process follows a systematic six-stage approach, with each stage building on the previous one:

### Stage 1: Business Case and Strategic Alignment
**"Why Do It"**

Validating the legitimacy of the business need and its alignment with corporate strategy.

**Key Activities:**
- Define business problem and strategic drivers
- Assess organizational readiness
- Establish business case and ROI expectations
- Secure stakeholder alignment

---

### Stage 2: Sourcing Model Analysis
**"How to Do It"**

Making a strategic choice between "Build", "Buy", and "Open Source" approaches.

**Key Activities:**
- Evaluate build vs. buy vs. open source trade-offs
- Assess internal capability and capacity
- Analyze total cost of ownership for each approach
- Determine sourcing strategy

---

### Stage 3: Preliminary Evaluation and Shortlisting
**"What to Do"**

Using the Generic Tool Selection Scorecard to conduct a high-level evaluation of multiple candidates to shortlist 1-2 finalists.

**Key Activities:**
- Define evaluation criteria and weights
- Conduct preliminary assessment of candidates
- Apply scoring methodology
- Shortlist finalists for detailed evaluation

---

### Stage 4: In-Depth Due Diligence
**"How Much Does It Cost"**

Conducting a rigorous Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return on Investment (ROI) analysis on the shortlisted candidates only.

**Key Activities:**
- Detailed cost analysis and TCO modeling
- ROI and business impact assessment
- Risk and dependency analysis
- Vendor capability and stability review

---

### Stage 5: Final Selection, PoC, and Contract Negotiation
**"Prove It"**

Finalizing the choice and mitigating risk through a Proof of Concept (PoC) and contract negotiations.

**Key Activities:**
- Conduct proof of concept or pilot
- Negotiate commercial terms and SLAs
- Finalize contract and legal terms
- Prepare for implementation

---

### Stage 6: Post-Investment Value Assessment
**"Was It Worth It"**

To be conducted post-implementation to ensure the long-term benefits of the investment and to continuously refine the decision-making process.

**Key Activities:**
- Monitor implementation progress and adoption
- Measure business value realization
- Assess vendor performance against SLAs
- Capture lessons learned for future selections

## Key Principles

1. **Funnel-Based Approach**: Broad screening early, detailed analysis later
2. **Stage-Gate Process**: Only proposals passing review advance to next stage
3. **Structured Evaluation**: Consistent criteria and scoring methodology
4. **Risk Mitigation**: PoC and detailed due diligence before final commitment
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Post-investment assessment to refine future processes
