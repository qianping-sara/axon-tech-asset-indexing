# CoE Governance Charter

## Executive Summary

The Automation Center of Excellence (CoE) Governance Charter establishes the foundational framework for delivering high-value, high-feasibility automation initiatives across the enterprise. This charter defines the CoE's vision, guiding principles, operating model, and systematic approach to adoption and scaling.

---

## 1. CoE Vision & Business Scope

### 1.1 CoE Objectives

The Automation CoE is established to:

- **Accelerate business process automation** - Drive rapid deployment of automation solutions across the enterprise
- **Reduce operational inefficiencies** - Eliminate manual, repetitive processes to improve productivity
- **Enhance customer experience** - Improve service delivery through automation and process optimization
- **Provide strategic advisor capability** - Serve as trusted advisor for internal and external stakeholder experience
- **Lay the foundation for long-term automation scalability and sustainability** - Build sustainable, scalable automation capabilities

### 1.2 Guiding Principles

The CoE operates under five core principles:

1. **Reliable** - Deliver consistent, dependable automation solutions
2. **Repeatable** - Establish standardized, reusable patterns and processes
3. **Scalable** - Design solutions that grow with business needs
4. **Ease of maintenance** - Ensure solutions are maintainable and sustainable
5. **Trackable** - Maintain visibility and measurability of all initiatives


## 2. Domain-Driven Value Approach

### 2.1 Core Concepts

**Business Domain**
- A division or subset of the enterprise business
- Domains are sizeable enough that the value from "transforming" them would outweigh the costs
- Example: Servicing domain

**Value Levers**
- Core outcomes or ways in which the organization would like to drive value
- Examples: Revenue optimization, Customer satisfactory, Ops Efficiency, Cost Optimization

**Solutions**
- Digital and/or automation opportunities that align with and will deliver the value levers
- Examples: Claim processing automation, Revival qualification automation

**Use Cases**
- Solutions broken down into individual models, root cause analyses, diagnoses, etc.
- Examples: Fast Claim, Partial STP Claim, Retention, Knowledge Bot, OCR

### 2.2 Domain Value Mapping

The CoE prioritizes initiatives based on the following value lever mapping:

## 3. Systematic Impact Planning

### 3.1 End-to-End Impact Assessment Framework

For each prioritized domain, the CoE systematically evaluates upstream and downstream impacts across five dimensions:
![Systematically plan for upstream and downstream impacts](/assets/architecture/policies/images/updown-stream-impact.jpg)

#### **End-to-End Processes**
- **Question**: How is the process affected?
- **Upstream Impacts**: Input process redesign, revised workflows, end-to-end outcomes alignment, cross-functional performance discussions
- **Downstream Impacts**: Better data usage, adjusted workflows, end-to-end outcomes alignment, cross-functional performance discussions

#### **Performance Management**
- **Question**: How to track performance?
- **Upstream Impacts**: Cross-functional performance discussions
- **Downstream Impacts**: Routing by skill-type, technology and decision-making capability building

#### **Organization and Skills**
- **Question**: How are people affected?
- **Upstream Impacts**: Cross-functional team alignment, "Supplier" capability building
- **Downstream Impacts**: Routing by skill-type, technology and decision-making capability building

#### **Mindsets and Behaviors**
- **Question**: How to bring people on board?
- **Upstream Impacts**: "End-to-end outcome" orientation, "Quality in, quality out" discipline
- **Downstream Impacts**: "Value-added, augmented" orientation, "Trust, but verify" discipline

### 3.2 Strategic Considerations

For each domain, the CoE addresses:
- Strategic, operational, tactical, and risk-related considerations
- How upstream and downstream domains will be impacted to ensure "full potential" value capture
- Comprehensive impact assessment to drive holistic transformation

## 4. Adoption and Scaling Model

### 4.1 Five-Step Adoption Cycle

The CoE follows a systematic five-step cycle for adoption and scaling:

![Adoption and Scaling Model](/assets/architecture/policies/images/adoption.jpg)

1. **Continuously Re-prioritize and Fund Domains**
   - Ongoing assessment of domain priorities
   - Resource allocation based on strategic value

2. **Prepare for Adoption and Scale**
   - Stakeholder engagement and readiness assessment
   - Capability and infrastructure preparation

3. **Drive Adoption & Operating Model Change**
   - Implementation of automation solutions
   - Organizational change management

4. **Scale and Capture Impact**
   - Expand successful solutions across the organization
   - Measure and communicate impact

5. **Build Execution Velocity and Capabilities**
   - Establish repeatable processes and patterns
   - Develop internal expertise and capabilities

### 4.2 Continuous Improvement Loop

The adoption cycle is continuous, with learnings from each iteration informing the next prioritization and funding decisions.

## 5. Success Metrics

### 5.1 Business Metrics

| Metric | Funeral Claims | Revival | Cancellation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Productivity** | 48/4/1hr Completion | 4 day Completion | TBD |
| **Cycle Time** | E2E Cycle time | Revival before collection date | |
| **Quality** | Paid before funeral | Success Rate, Quality Rating | |

### 5.2 Technical Metrics

| Metric | Funeral Claims | Revival | Cancellation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Automation Coverage** | Full Auto %, Partial Auto % | Full Auto %, Partial Auto % | TBD |
| **Quality Indicators** | | 2nd pass thru % | |

## 6. Governance and Accountability

### 6.1 Decision-Making Framework

- Domain prioritization decisions are made collaboratively with business stakeholders
- Impact assessments inform all major initiative decisions
- Regular review cycles ensure alignment with strategic objectives

### 6.2 Reporting and Transparency

- Monthly progress reporting against Phase 1 timeline
- Quarterly business metrics review
- Continuous tracking of technical metrics and automation coverage
