# Getting Started with Axon

Welcome to Axon, your comprehensive technical asset discovery and management platform.



## 🎯 Platform Positioning

### The Problem

> When automation assets are scattered across disconnected systems (Gravitee, EA Platform, Confluence...etc), developers waste time searching and often reinvent solutions that already exist. 

### The Solution: Your Unified Discovery Portal

> **Axon is the Golden Index for automation assets.** We don't replace your existing systems—we connect them, providing a **single search interface** to discover all automation capabilities across your organization.

### Core Value Proposition

> - 🔍 **Contextual Search**: Search across all asset types and discover related assets with one click
> - 🛡️ **Trusted Metadata**: Indexed and linked data from your source systems
> - 📈 **Accelerate Delivery, Reduce Costs**: Reuse proven assets instead of rebuilding

### Key Differentiators

> **Unlike Gravitee (API Portal)**
> - Gravitee is the "System of Record" for APIs (publication, security, lifecycle)
> - Axon is the "System of Discovery" for automation—it answers "To implement this business process, which API, which RPA Bot, and which AI model should I use?"
> 
> **Unlike Sparx (Architecture modeling)**
> - Sparx is the "System of Record" for architecture blueprints & modeling tool
> - Axon is a "practical utility" for frontline developers—a bottom-up discovery tool focused on "what's available for reuse today"
